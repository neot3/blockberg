# BLOCKBERG

## TERMINAL DERIVATIVES TRADING INFRA ON SOLANA

Blockberg is our trading terminal on Solana for cryptocurrency derivatives with MagicBlock and Pyth integration. 

---

## WHAT WE'VE BUILT FOR SOLANA COLOSSEUM 2025 

### Infra

The platform operates on this architecture:

1. **Client Layer** - SvelteKit 2 frontend with terminal interface
2. **Settlement Layer** - MagicBlock ephemeral rollup 
3. **Verification Layer** - Solana devnet / mainnet-beta for final settlement

This design separates execution latency from settlement guarantees. MagicBlock's ephemeral runtime is taking care of position opens/closes with <100ms confirmation, while Solana gives us cryptographic finality.

### Historical Context

Bloomberg Terminal (1981) revolutionized financial markets by giving live price data and execution in a unified interface. The system's orange-on-black CRT aesthetic is the standard for professional traders.

Blockberg applies this model to decentralized derivatives:
- command navigation (`GO` button execution)
- price feeds via Pyth Network oracles
- execution feedback
- P&L tracking

The terminal metaphor maps naturally to blockchain constraints both systems require deterministic state transitions and cryptographic verification.

## TECHNICAL COMPONENTS

### Frontend (SvelteKit 2)

**Framework Selection**
- SvelteKit chosen for compile-time reactivity (no virtual DOM overhead)
- Svelte 5 runes architecture for granular state management
- Vite 7 build system with tree-shaking for minimal bundle size

**Modules**

`src/routes/+page.svelte` - Main terminal interface
- Pyth price feed integration (2s polling interval)
- WebSocket connection to Hermes Client for updates
- Reactive position management with automatic P&L calculation
- Wallet adapter integration (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)

**Price Feed Architecture**
```typescript
const PYTH_FEEDS = {
  SOL: '0xef0d8b6fda2ceba41da15d4095d1da392a0d2f8ed0c6c7bc0f4cfac8c280b56d',
  BTC: '0xe62df6c8b4a85fe1a67db44dc12de5db330f7ac66b72dc658afedf0f4a415b43',
  // Additional feeds...
}
```

Pyth gives us our confidence intervals and EMA pricing! It's important for derivatives valuation. The system displays:
- Spot price (current oracle value)
- EMA price (exponential moving average, volatility)
- Confidence spread (percentage uncertainty)
- Data time (seconds since last update)

Now traders can assess slippage risk before execution.

**Trading Execution**

Position guide:
1. User specifies size, direction (LONG/SHORT), optional TP/SL
2. Frontend calculates collateral requirements
3. Transaction submitted to MagicBlock RPC
4. Ephemeral rollup confirms position open (<100ms)
5. Position state stored on-chain with entry price, timestamp
6. P&L calculated reactively against live oracle prices

The system supports both spot swaps and leveraged positions. Spot trades execute as simple token swaps (USDT ↔ SOL/BTC/ETH/AVAX/LINK). Positions track entry price and calculate unrealized P&L on every price update.

### Backend (Solana Programs)

**Program Architecture**

The system deploys 9 specialized programs to MagicBlock's ephemeral runtime:

| Program | Address | Function |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `close-position` | `CXnKyp5D...` | Position settlement and P&L realization |
| `competition` | `FPKpeKHn...` | Competition state management |
| `join-competition` | `5aJzg88r...` | Player registration and verification |
| `leaderboard` | `BCrmcoi7...` | Ranked P&L aggregation |
| `open-position` | `GdWvbNgb...` | Collateral lock and position initialization |
| `position` | `9ACLRxNo...` | Position account structure |
| `settle-competition` | `32S5nHLK...` | Prize distribution logic |
| `trading-account` | `3PDo9AKe...` | User account initialization |
| `paper-trading` | `b6NjCktq...` | Mock balance management |

**Anchor Framework**

Programs use Anchor 0.30.1 for instruction parsing and account validation:

```rust
// Anchor provides compile-time verification of:
// - Account ownership (program must own modified accounts)
// - Signer verification (transaction must be signed by authority)
// - Account discriminators (prevents instruction spoofing)
```

This eliminates entire classes of exploits (reentrancy, unauthorized access, type confusion) that is an issue for EVM contracts.

**MagicBlock Integration**

MagicBlock is integrated as a Solana fork with modified consensus:
- ephemeral runtime runs on dedicated validator set
- tx confirm in <100ms (vs 400ms on mainnet)
- snapshots periodically committed to mainnet
- program invocations (CPIs) work identically to mainnet

RPC endpoint: `https://rpc.magicblock.app/devnet/`

### Oracle Integration (Pyth Network)

Pyth is integrated as our pull oracle:
1. Publishers (exchanges like Binance, FTX) push signed price data to Hermes aggregator
2. Frontend fetches latest price updates via Hermes Client
3. Price data includes confidence interval and EMA
4. On-chain programs verify publisher signatures before accepting prices

This differs from Chainlink's push model bc Pyth prices update every 400ms but programs only pay for updates they consume.

**Price Feed Structure**
```typescript
{
  price: number,           // Spot price (adjusted for exponent)
  confidence: number,      // Confidence interval (± basis points)
  emaPrice: number,        // Exponential moving average
  publishTime: number,     // Unix timestamp
  spread: number          // confidence/price as percentage
}
```

The confidence interval represents publisher disagreement. High spread indicates:
- Low liquidity
- Oracle downtime
- Market volatility

Blockberg displays this metric prominently to prevent trades during unreliable data.

## DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

Production URL: `https://blockberg.vercel.app/`

**Build Configuration**
```json
{
  "framework": "sveltekit",
  "buildCommand": "vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "public"
}
```

SvelteKit adapter-auto detects Vercel and configures serverless functions for SSR routes.


### Backend Deployment (Solana/MagicBlock)

Programs deployed to MagicBlock devnet at addresses listed in `Anchor.toml`.

**Deployment Process**
1. `anchor build` - Compiles Rust programs to BPF bytecode
2. `anchor deploy --provider.cluster https://rpc.magicblock.app/devnet/` - Uploads to MagicBlock
3. Programs are upgradeable (controlled by deployer keypair)

pogramID : ENpbjfPxXx9fLhLDcqbLsHmo25LRU4fW9RXFfrqbKbmo
treasury : 8ukdXqiEb7jntV7wCdsnYNq8sUXSgcYSoyLtVfkMccMv

**Account Initialization**

Users must initialize trading accounts before first trade:
1. Frontend calls `initializeAccount(pairIndex)` for each trading pair
2. Program creates PDA (Program Derived Address) for user
3. PDA stores mock token balances (10,000 USDT starting capital)

This is paper trading! All trades execute on-chain but use simulated collateral.

## COMPETITIVE TRADING SYSTEM

### Competition Mechanics

**Round Structure**
- Fixed duration (default: 1 hour)
- Starting capital: 10,000 USDT equivalent per pair
- P&L calculated across all 5 trading pairs (SOL, BTC, ETH, AVAX, LINK)
- Leaderboard ranks by total portfolio value

**Scoring Algorithm**
```typescript
totalValue = ∑(tokenInBalance + tokenOutBalance * currentPrice)
pnl = totalValue - initialCapital
rank = sortDescending(allPlayers.pnl)
```

This incentivizes:
- Cross-pair arbitrage
- Volatility trading
- Risk management (no leverage limits but liquidations hurt P&L)

**Prize Distribution**

`settle-competition` program distributes rewards:
1. Competition ends (block timestamp > endTime)
2. Program reads final leaderboard state
3. Prize pool allocated by rank (e.g., 50% to 1st, 30% to 2nd, 20% to 3rd)
4. Winnings transferred to player wallets

On-chain settlement prevents disputes abd all trades are cryptographically verifiable.

---

## ORACLE ECONOMICS

### Pyth Network

Pyth aggregates prices from 90+ first-party publishers (exchanges, market makers). Each publisher signs price data with their private key. The Hermes aggregator combines these into a weighted median.

**Why Pull Oracles?**

Traditional push oracles (Chainlink) update prices on a fixed schedule, regardless of consumer demand. This wastes gas on inactive pairs.

Pyth's pull model:
- Publishers constantly stream signed prices to Hermes
- Programs fetch only the prices they need
- Updates cost ~0.0001 SOL per price feed

For Blockberg's 5 trading pairs, this means 0.0005 SOL per trade (~$0.10 at $200/SOL). Far cheaper than Ethereum L1 where oracle updates can cost $50+.

**Data Integrity**

Each price update includes:
- Publisher signatures (ed25519)
- Merkle proof of inclusion
- Timestamp (prevents replay attacks)
- Confidence interval (publisher agreement threshold)

Programs verify these cryptographic proofs before accepting prices. This is important so we don't have:
- Oracle manipulation
- Stale price attacks
- Front-running via delayed updates

## TERMINAL INTERFACE DESIGN

### Command Navigation

The `GO` button executes commands typed in the input bar:
```
> SOL [GO] → Switches to SOL/USDT pair
> BTC [GO] → Switches to BTC/USDT pair
```

Future extensions could support:
```
> LONG 100 SOL @185.50 TP 190 SL 183 [GO]
> CLOSE ALL [GO]
> HISTORY 7D [GO]
```

This mirrors Bloomberg's command syntax (e.g., `AAPL EQUITY GP [GO]` for Apple stock chart).

### Visual Hierarchy

**Color Coding** (Bloomberg Standard)
- Orange (#ff9500): Headers, labels, neutral text
- Green (#00ff00): Positive values, buy actions, longs
- Red (#ff0000/#ff4444): Negative values, sell actions, shorts
- White (#ffffff): Primary data (prices, balances)
- Gray (#666): Metadata, secondary info

**Typography**
- Monospace fonts (`Courier New`) for all text
- Maintains terminal aesthetic
- Improves number readability (fixed-width digits)

**Layout**
- Three-column grid (News | Chart | Leaderboard)
- Fixed header with status indicators
- Scrollable panels (constrained heights prevent layout shift)

This layout maximizes information density - critical for trading UIs where every pixel counts.

---

## PERFORMANCE 

### Frontend 

- Initial bundle: ~140 KB (gzipped)
- TradingView iframe: ~2 MB (external CDN)
- Price updates: 2s interval (Pyth polling)
- Position updates: 5s interval (on-chain state fetch)

**Optimization Techniques**
- Code splitting via dynamic imports
- Svelte's compiled output (no runtime framework code)
- Lazy loading for competition routes

### Blockchain 

- MagicBlock confirmation: <100ms
- Solana finality: ~13s (32 confirmed blocks)
- Oracle update latency: 400ms (Pyth publisher interval)

**Transaction Costs**
- Position open: ~0.001 SOL (~$0.20)
- Position close: ~0.001 SOL
- Account initialization: ~0.005 SOL (one-time per pair)

Solana's fee market remains stable even during congestion.

## OUR COMPETITORS

### Blockberg vs. Traditional Exchanges

| Feature | Blockberg | Binance Futures | dYdX |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|------|
| Settlement | On-chain (Solana) | Centralized DB | Off-chain (StarkEx) |
| Latency | <100ms | ~10ms | ~50ms |
| Custody | Self-custody | Exchange-custodied | Non-custodial |
| Oracle | Pyth (pull) | Internal price engine | Maker/Chainlink |
| Transparency | Full (on-chain state) | Opaque | Partial (L2 state roots) |

Blockberg sacrifices ~90ms latency for full transparency and self-custody. This trade-off favors retail traders (who distrust CEXs post-FTX) over HFT firms (who need sub-millisecond execution).

### Differentiation

**vs. Drift Protocol** (Solana-native perps)
- Drift uses virtual AMM for pricing; Blockberg uses Pyth oracles
- Drift supports cross-collateral; Blockberg isolates pairs
- Drift optimized for liquidity pools; Blockberg for competition trading

**vs. Jupiter Perps** (Solana DEX aggregator)
- Jupiter routes orders across liquidity sources; Blockberg is a standalone venue
- Jupiter uses JLP pool for leverage; Blockberg uses paper trading (for now)
- Jupiter targets DeFi power users; Blockberg targets Bloomberg Terminal users
